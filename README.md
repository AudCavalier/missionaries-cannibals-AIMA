# missionaries-cannibals-AIMA
A simple solution to the missionaries and cannibals problem using the 
AIMA classes search and utils, this class presents an instance of the 
well-known missionaries and cannibals problem.

The goal is to create an instance of the problem giving just the initial 
state and the desired goal state, then using the 
[AIMA](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) classes search and utils 
it explores the states tree to get the solution and prints the path 
followed to reach the solution.

### Overview

This was a project done for the school subject "Artificial 
Intelligence", and a classical one for anyone learning AI, as 
we were using the book "Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach" 
(AIMA) we were assigned this project, what i present here is my approach 
to the solution.

### Setup

For now i'm only providing only my code, as the search and utils classes 
can be found on the [AIMA](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) 
repository. 

a quick setup could be: 

First dowload the [AIMA](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) 
repository or just the search and utils classes from them.

Then download Canibales.py from this repository, place it in the same 
folder with search and utils classes

Run Canibales.py, it should show the state nodes from the initial state 
to the solution state
